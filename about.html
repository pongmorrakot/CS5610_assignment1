        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I listed a few random information about myself in case you are curious, because I don't know what I should put here.</p>
        <p>In no particular order, here are some of the reasons I really like Vancouver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food selection are diverse. Most places have really good food.</li>
            <li>Nature surrounding the city is stunning.</li>
            <li>Public transit is great (compared to other North American cities).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Things I don't particularly enjoy about Vancouver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The amount of rent I am paying.</li>
            <li>My bike got stolen, so I am sad.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In descending order, here are things that I wasted most of free time on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My phone</li>
            <li>Scrolling mindlessly on YouTube</li>
            <li>Genshin Impact</li>
        </ol>
